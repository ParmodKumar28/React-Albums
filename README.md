# React Albums App 🎵

This is a simple React application that fetches and displays albums from a dummy API. Additionally, it allows users to add, update, and delete albums, even though these operations are dummy calls and won't actually modify the server data.

## Features 🚀

- **Fetch and Show Albums**: The app fetches albums from the JSONPlaceholder API and displays them.
- **Add Album**: Users can add a new album by filling out a form and making a POST request (dummy) to the API.
- **Update Album**: Users can update an existing album by clicking on the update icon. This makes a PUT request (dummy) to the API.
- **Delete Album**: Users can delete an album by clicking on the delete icon. This triggers a DELETE request (dummy) to the API.

## Technologies Used 💻

- React
- Fetch API for making HTTP requests
- uuid library for generating unique IDs
- react-toastify for displaying notifications
